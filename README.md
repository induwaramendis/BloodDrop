# BloodDrop
The Blood Drop project streamlines blood donation and request processes through a mobile app and web platform, addressing challenges faced by blood banks and individuals, allowing efficient communication and management.
The web portal will empower blood bank administrators to monitor and manage 
registrations and donations, track real-time bloodstock inventory and required blood types, send 
targeted notifications to potential donors based on location, and generate insights and reports on 
donation trends and blood requirements.
